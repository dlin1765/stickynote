# How it was made
Sticky Note+ was created for a software design class at Santa Clara University. As a group, we wanted to create an improved version of the notes app on IOS. Our goal was to create a simple way to keep track of different tasks and events while not distracting from normal note taking ability.

Since this was the first mobile app we were going to make, we decided on using the Flutter since we thought widgets would allow us to test the UI quicker and make more progress on the actual features of the app. All of us were all pretty used to Java/C++ syntax so adjusting to Dart wasn't going to be a problem.
